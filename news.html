        <p>HQ Power is committed to integrating itself in the community and becoming a main actor on the economic and social welfare of the Mamba Sector community where it works. Beyond the various authorizations and contractual agreement with Rwandese authorities, HQ Power sees herself as a guest in the Akanyaru community and Gisagara District in large. To that purpose, HQ Power is dedicated to being a good neighbor and improve the living standards of the community. Apart from local people employment, local purchasing, and the compensations offered to the project affected persons (PAPs) through land expropriation; HQ Power has developed a Corporate Social Responsibility program around different thematic areas that continue to be enhanced over time during the lifespan of the project. Amongst the key areas include education, housing, health, and livelihood restoration / resilience programs (on agriculture and domestic animals – pig and cow project targeting vulnerable persons.)</p>

        <p>Yumn Limited – HQ Power understands that the peat production operations have impacted on the livelihoods of families who relied on peat land for their farming activities. The project has hence embarked on improving and enhancing the local people livelihoods to better status than pre-project levels through enhancing their households’ incomes. Apart from prioritizing households affected by the project in the employment policy, HQ power has a project aimed towards provision of Cows and Pigs to the vulnerable households. From November 2020 through March 2021, a total of 3 cows and 57 pigs were donated to 60 households serving approximately 240 family members within Kabumbwe and Gakoma cells of Mamba Sector. It is anticipated that as a result, the household head’s ability to provide for their household’s needs will improve from the sale of offspring’s, milk, and application of organic manure to their farms which will increase food production. In the financial year 2021 /2022, Yumn project has targeted 51 vulnerable households with approximately 200 family members to benefit from the Cow / Pig / chicken donation project.</p>

          According to Isabel Kamariza, President and Founder of Solid Africa, most patients under the food programme come from remote areas, making it difficult for their families to bring them food every day, especially during the lockdown.
